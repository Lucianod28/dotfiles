# dotfiles
This repo contains the configuration files (dotfiles) and plugins (as git submodules) I use for vim
and zsh on Linux and macOS.

## Installation
Run:
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Lucianod28/dotfiles
./dotfiles/install.sh
```
If you have any machine-specific zsh configuration you can create a `local.sh` file inside the `zsh`
directory and add it there.
